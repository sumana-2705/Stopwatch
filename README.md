# ⏱️ Textual Stopwatch: A Learning Project

This Stopwatch app is built using the **Textual framework** as a hands-on project for learning purpose. Inspired by the [official tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpOBRI56GXM&list=PLHhDR_Q5Me1MxO4LmfzMNNQyKfwa275Qe), this project helped me understand how to create interactive terminal applications with Textual. It’s a simple yet effective way to learn event handling, UI components, and real-time updates in a TUI (Text-based User Interface).
